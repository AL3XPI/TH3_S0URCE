Python text-based game. WIP. A beginner Python project, I'm still new to this whole "coding" business.
## Installation instructions
### Windows
1. Make sure you have [Python 3.6.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-362/) installed
2. Download the game from right here (the [repository page](https://github.com/AL3XPI/TH3_S0URCE))
3. Extract the .zip folder
4. Open the newly unzipped folder
5. Right click TH3_S0URC3.py and click Edit with IDLE 3.6
6. Click "Run", and then click Run Module
7.  Enjoy the game, it will be buggy, because it is still in HEAVY development.
